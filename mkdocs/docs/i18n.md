# Multiple Languages

## Dashboard

The dashbord is currently not translateable.

## Bot

All slash commands & buttons respond in your Discord language.

Logs and other messages that are not trigged by slash commands or buttons, use
the server's language you can set in the Community settings.

If we don't support your language, we fall back to `English, US`.

## Contribute

You can contribute on our crowdin: https://crowdin.com/project/the-cleaner

We only support the languages that Discord also natively supports.

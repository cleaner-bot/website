# Risk rating

We use a technology called risk rating to calculate the riskyness of a user.

We show this score as part of our join log to aide staff with detecting risky
accounts that join their server.

The score is also used for on-join challenges to determine if an interactive
challenge should be issued or the user should be let through.

## Factors

Factors that influence the risk rating:

-   account age (most important factor!)
-   avatar
-   badges
-   magic \*

`*` A bit of magic is always involved and real magic stays undisclosed :)

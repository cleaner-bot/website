# April Updates

Update time! We released several new features in April and this is a collection of them.

## Statistics

We added the statistics plugin where you can see everything the radar contains
but only for your server.

[Check it out!](/dash?component=statistics)

## Logging

We added two new logging options:

-   leave (will log when someone leaves)
-   verify (will log when someone verifies)

They are disabled by default like join log.

Join log and most other logs now also include username#tag.

[Check it out!](/dash?component=logging)

## Report as phishing

We added message reporting for moderators.
They can report a message as phishing and it'll be reported to us and
the message will be handled as if it was normal phishing.
(deleted & author gets punished)

## Report to staff

A feature for your server that allows users to report messages that will be
reported to your moderators in a separate channel.

[Check it out!](/dash?component=report)

This is currently in beta, ask in our Discord for access.

## Other stuff

-   Using bulk delete now to delete messages faster
-   Added Top.gg voting reminder
-   No longer fetching full member list to improve start up time

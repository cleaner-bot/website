### Applicable legal bases

Below you will find an overview of the legal basis, the GDPR, on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection requirements may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of this in the privacy policy.

- **Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a. GDPR)** - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose or for several specific purposes.
- **Fulfillment of the contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b. GDPR)** - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures that are carried out at the request of the data subject.
- **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR)** - The processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the person responsible or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned, which require the protection of personal data, outweigh the above.

**National data protection regulations in Germany:** In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the law on the protection against misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. In addition, the state data protection laws of the individual federal states can apply.


## Security measures

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

## Deletion of data

The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as the consent permitted for processing is revoked or other permissions are no longer applicable (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data is no longer applicable or is not required for the purpose).

If the data is not deleted because it is required for other legally permissible purposes, its processing will be limited to these purposes. This means that the data is locked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.

Our data protection information may also contain further information on the storage and deletion of data, which have priority for the respective processing.

- **Messages**: Generally messages are only kept for a minute but in special cases can be stored for up to 10 minutes. (anonymized messages may be kept for longer)

- **Join information**: We store anonymized join information for up to 10 minutes.

- **Error logs**: Error logs are kept for up to 2 weeks and then automatically deleted.

We ask you to inform yourself regularly about the content of our privacy policy. We will adapt this privacy policy as soon as the changes to the data processing carried out by us make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require your cooperation (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.

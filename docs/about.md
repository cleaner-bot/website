## Story

The Cleaner (originally Mr. Clean) was designed to be a small antiraid bot for my private server.

However, phishing waves became more and more common in July, so I added phishing detection.
Really simple distance calculation between steamcommunity and every domain in every message sent.
If it's similar, it just bans.

And it worked!

I convinced two friends of mine with medium sized servers (2,3k and 3,4k members) to invite the bot and it was decimating the urls of that time.

With time I improved the bot, added more detections and made The Cleaner even better.

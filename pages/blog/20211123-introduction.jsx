                The Cleaner is a Discord Bot that is entirely focused on keeping your server clean.

                Originally only intended as anti-spam bot in March 2021, we have developed him into a beast that cleans raids, phishing and other kinds of dirthy content.

                The Cleaner became semi-public in July, joining several CS:GO oriented servers with multiple thousand members to combat the phishing waves. With success!

                During this "semi-public" testing phase, The Cleaner collected data to fight against phishing waves and raids more effectively.
                This data has been put to use in the now public version to fight phishing waves earlier and faster than ever!
